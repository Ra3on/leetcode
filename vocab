contiguous memeory allocation( one block )
no bound checking if you access out of bounce you wuill get grarbasge values
int x[x] static
int 8 arr = new int[]

vector = list of elements, dynamic in size 
contiguous memeory allocation( one block )
dynamically allocated and can grow as needed if more memory is needed then reallocated

vector<type> name;


compile time, when code is being converted to machine code 
syntax  check, type checking, 

run time after the program has successfully compile and being exucted
divding by 0, nmull pointer or out of bounce array access
